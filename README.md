# wolframs-rules
C# / .Net project to output Wolfram's rules


**In Development**
This is a personal project to explore some of the rules and concepts around elementery cellular automotans defined in Wolfram's rules. This code base was never meant to be algorithmically exceptional or efficient, it's not going to win any prizes for being novel!
